				<h2>What is Crossfit?</h2>
				<p>Simply stated Crossfit is defined as constantly varied – functional movements – performed at high intensity.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Constantly varied – Workouts are always different, an element that keeps the body from adapting and challenges participants in ways other workouts don’t…</li>
					<li>Functional movements – Universal recruitment patterns (movements we do every day, i.e. if you ever dropped your keys and bend over to pick them up you just did a squat!)</li>
					<li>Performed at high intensity – There is an element of time (intensity) associated with the exercises.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ultimate goal at Five Point Crossfit is to increase our client’s work capacity, i.e. their ability to do work. We want you to be able to carry bigger loads, longer distances, in less time! Are you planning on completing a Tough Mudder or Spartan Race?. Five Points Crossfit combines resistance training with high intensity cardiovascular exercises to prepare you for the challenges you’ll face on a Tough Mudder or Spartan Race course.</p>

If you are not, then you need to schedule an Intro session with one of our coaches. Go to the same link, and click on the Intro Crossfit Sign up and then register. Enter some info about yourself, sign our waiver, and hit “Calendar” for an Introduction to Crossfit (they are the ones in RED) and select a convenient time from the choices given. The times available are on Mondays at 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm or by appointment only. Click on the time you want and then hit “Register”–> “Continue” and finally “Sign Up”.</p>
				<p>Except for experienced CrossFit athletes, all of our prospective clients begin with an introductory session. After all, if we don’t know you, then how can we train you properly, right? During this FREE 1-on-1 session, we’ll go over the definition of CrossFit, and take you through a baseline workout to see how you move during utilizing some functional movements. You’ll also have all your membership questions answered and get a tour of our facility. It ensures that our program is a good match for you and vice-versa.
